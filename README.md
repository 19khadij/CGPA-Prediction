# CGPA-Prediction

This project is focused on analyzing a dataset called "The_Grades_Dataset.csv" using Python and scikit-learn. 
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the training of two machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree Regressor. 
The goal is to predict target values based on input features and evaluate the model's performance.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
Install the required dependencies (see Dependencies).

Run the Python script main.py to execute the machine learning pipeline.

Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Place your dataset, "The_Grades_Dataset.csv," in the same directory as the project files.

Modify the script to fit your dataset or analysis requirements.

Run the main.py script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
